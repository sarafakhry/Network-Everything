When finishing this reading assignment I came across a lot of terms I had never known about before such as IoT, UX and UI. What helped through this reading was mostly the real life examples Claire Rowland offered in her first chapter that gave me an idea what each term meant and how we come across these terms in our everyday lives. This chapter has helped me grasp the idea of how these terms are crucial to the creative process of designing a product. Even though there are some terms I'm still a bit shaky about.
