When finishing this reading assignment I came across a lot of terms I had never known about before such as IoT, UX and UI. What helped through this reading was mostly the real life examples Claire Rowland offered in her first chapter that gave me an idea what each term meant and how we come across these terms in our everyday lives. This chapter has helped me grasp the idea of how these terms are crucial to the creative process of designing a product. Even though there are some terms I'm still a bit shaky about. 

There are a few things she mentioned that I found very interesting and important to think about when designing products for real life. She mentions how frustrating it is when there is latency on the internet, but we accept it since it's just a part of using the internet and how real-life objects respond immediately to us. It is irritating enough to have to wait for the internet to respond to our requests, but having real-world objects not respond to us immediately would just be too much; "This could make the real world start to feel very broken" (7).

This reading was very new to me considering that in Egypt, our technology is not nearly as advanced as all the examples mentioned in the book. Maybe that's for the best however, considering we can barely keep up with the technololgy we currently have. Seeing these examples however have made me curious to see what technological advances the future holds for us, and whether that means that when all the examples put forth in this chapter become 'old news', Egypt will start adopting them? Whether we'll be caught up or still where we're currently at.
