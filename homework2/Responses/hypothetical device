                                          Friendship frame
                                          
I once came across the idea of having a pair of identical room decor shared between people who dont live near each other. The idea was when one of the devices was touched, both of them would light up. It was meant to be a friendship greeting where each person doesn't have to pick up the phone and call the other, but rather when one crosses the other's mind, they would simply touch whatever the device was and if the other had the other device infront of him and saw the device lighting up, he'd know that the other person had thought of him. I'm making it sound a lot more complicated than it actually is.

Interaction Design:
How the device behaves is simple. Two devices exist, each in different places but react the same. When one of the devices is touched, and in this case since it's a friendship gesture i was thinking of something on the lines of a picture frame, both devices light up instantly. If both devices are being touched at the same time, they light up twice as bright. Once they both remove their hand from the device, the light goes out as well.

Industrial Design:
Since the industrial design refers to the aesthetic and functional deisgn of the physical hardware, I was thinking something that shows a friendly gesture, like a picture frame filled with LED fiary lights or a little desk decor. Since it's supposed to look as friendly as possible, wires shouldn't be sticking out of it but that's about it for its physical appearance.
