# Friendship Frame?

Idea:

Two frames for two people living in different parts of the world. 

Frames are covered with LEDs. If any one person touches his frame, both frames light up.
Can be used for a group of friends where each person has a unique color code and when one person touches, all other people from the groups' LEDs light up with that person's color code.

Index.html would not be different from the standard one we use in class, the only difference would be that the background would be the same picture there in the frame. Only one button used to light up LED's from index.html. no need for other button. LED's would automatically go out once 30 minutes have passed or the webpage is off.

Server.js and client.js would be the same since we only have one button needed on the html.
